# UnityCustomURP
This is a base project to create custom URP post processing filters using RenderPassFeature.

## ToDo
- Code a shader and use it with a ScriptableRenderPass.
- Create a ShaderGraph with multiple properties and a ScriptableRenderPass where the developer can set each propertie.
- [Completed at 2021/01/22] Create a simple greyscale shader using ShaderGraph and a simple ScriptableRenderPass to apply this shader as a post processing filter.
